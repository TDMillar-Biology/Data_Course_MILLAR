# Assignment 7 messy code
# Change this to "tidy" format using dplyr verbs

# There's an intuitive dplyr version for almost everything you see here.

# Note: Do not erase the original code, just comment it out and put your own equivalent code below each section
# i.e., change each line of indicated code to a tidy version that does the same thing.

# Look through those plots and answer the following questions:
# 1.  Which religious group correlates most strongly in a given area with the proportion of non-religious people?
# 2.  What is the direction of that correlation?
# 3.  What can you say about the relationships shown here?
# 4.  Examine the axis scales. How could you modify the code above to more accurately portray values on an "equal footing?"
