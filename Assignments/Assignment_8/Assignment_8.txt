1. 
According to the summary statistics from mod_full, there are a lot of insignificant variables. One of which is nitrogen availability with a p value of 0.30862. 
This could be due to the limitations of the model, and perhaps another model could be written to better show how nitrogren has an effect on growth rate. (After-all, 
Nitrogen does show a non-linear response over all). 

The following are just three more examples of insignificant interactions according to my model:
Nitrogen:Temperature (the interaction of Nitrogen and temp)                                          
HumidityLow:Temperature (having low humidity and its interaction with temp) and                                 
SpeciesP.ostreotus:Light:Nitrogen (being species P.ostreotus and its interaction with light and nitrogen)
                          
2.
Growth rate as a function of available nitrogen is a non-linear response.
